Let it be known that these terms and conditions, henceforth called "Terms," set forth herein, govern the use of the aforementioned Services, as bestowed upon thee by Freshbite, a humble enterprise dedicated to the well-being of the masses, with a mission most noble and pure.
Act II: The Consent of the Parties

By entering into this covenant, whether it be of thine own free will or by compulsion of circumstance, thou dost accept and consent to be bound by these Terms.
Whosoever doth access or avail themselves of Freshbite’s Services, whether by means of digital device, conveyance, or other such means, doth herewith declare their agreement to abide by these laws, rules, and conditions, in accordance with the wholesome spirit of Freshbite.
Act III: The Rights and Duties of Freshbite

Freshbite, the good steward of the Services, doth retain full authority to provide, alter, amend, or discontinue such Services at their discretion, without warning or notice, to fulfill its greater mission of nourishment for the many.
Freshbite doth pledge to take reasonable care and diligence in the provision of the Services, that they may be of highest quality and healthful to those who partake. Yet, no guarantee of perfection or flawlessness shall be made, for no mortal enterprise can claim such an ideal.
Act IV: The Rights and Duties of The User

Thou, the User, in partaking of the Services, dost covenant to be respectful of Freshbite, its agents, and the greater community that it serves.
Furthermore, thou shalt not use the Services to engage in unlawful, harmful, or improper conduct, nor shall thee misuse or exploit the fruits of Freshbite’s labor for purposes most vile.
It is thy solemn duty to maintain the confidentiality of any information entrusted unto thee by Freshbite, including, but not limited to, personal and account details, for the privacy of thyself and of Freshbite’s kingdom.
Act V: Payment and the Compensation for Services Rendered

Verily, Freshbite doth provide its Services in exchange for compensation, which shall be paid in such manner and at such times as stipulated by Freshbite.
Should thee fail to pay for the Services as agreed, Freshbite hath the right to suspend or cease the provision thereof until such payment be made.
Freshbite doth also retain the right to amend the pricing of its Services, but such changes shall be made known unto thee in fair and ample time before being put into effect.
Act VI: The Limitation of Liability

Freshbite doth not bear responsibility for any losses or damages, whether they be of body, soul, or fortune, that arise from the use or misuse of its Services.
No claim shall be brought against Freshbite for any interruption in service, errors or defects in the provisions of its Services, nor shall it be liable for any other conditions beyond its reasonable control.
Freshbite doth not hold itself accountable for any external links, services, or content not under its dominion or control.
Act VII: The Privacy of The User

Freshbite, in its noble duty to protect thy privacy, shall handle any personal information shared with it in accordance with its Privacy Policy, which is a part of these Terms.
The gathering, use, and sharing of such information shall be for purposes of improving thy experience with the Services, and such information shall not be disclosed to third parties unless required by law or for the provision of the Services themselves.
Act VIII: The Termination of Services

Should it come to pass that thou, the User, dost violate these Terms or act in a manner unbecoming, Freshbite hath the right to suspend or terminate thy access to its Services without warning, and with cause, in accordance with its good judgment.
Likewise, should Freshbite find it necessary to cease all operations or discontinue the Services, thy access shall be revoked forthwith, with no further obligation owed.
Act IX: The Dispute and Resolution

Should there arise a conflict, dispute, or contention between Freshbite and thee, the User, regarding these Terms or the use of the Services, all such matters shall be resolved through peaceful negotiation, without recourse to force or violence.
If such negotiation doth fail, the matter shall be resolved through the courts of the realm in which Freshbite doth hold its operations, and under the laws of that land.
Act X: The Severance of Invalid Provisions

Should any clause or provision of these Terms be found to be invalid or unenforceable, that clause shall be severed, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, unbroken and unshaken.
Act XI: The Amendments of the Terms

Freshbite, in its discretion, hath the right to amend or update these Terms at any time, as it doth see fit, with or without notice to thee, the User.
It shall be thy duty to remain informed of such changes, for continued use of the Services after amendments have been made shall be deemed as acceptance of the new Terms.

Thus, it is done. The covenant between thee and Freshbite is established. May thy experience be bounteous and thy sustenance plentiful.
